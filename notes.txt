To start:
    From base folder 'docker-compose up'
-Node server is using nodemon, so it should see changes
-To rebuild angular:
    From /web issue 'ng build'

Bringing the containers down and up will refresh node/api code.


Build on production w/ out aot
ng build --env=prod

To export droplet mongo data:
    On droplet:
    docker exec -it <container id> /bin/bash
    mongodump -d db -o /mongobackup
    exit
    sudo docker cp <container id>:/mongobackup /home/sdkraemer/

    On windows machine:
    Used filezilla to copy to C:/mongobackup
    Started docker on windows machine
    docker cp C:\mongobackup\db xrcise-mongodb:/mongobackup
    docker exec -it xrcise-mongodb /bin/bash 
    mongorestore --drop -d db /mongobackup
    exit

    -Created cronjob to put backups in /mongodbbackup/<datestamp>

 To call backfill_order.js to populate order column in guides exercises:
    docker cp C:\ng2\xrcise\api\scripts\backfill_order.js xrcise-mongodb:/  #copies to root directory in mongo container
    docker exec -it xrcise-mongodb /bin/bash
    mongo
    load("backfill_order.js");

To backfill createdBy field in guide
    docker cp C:\ng2\xrcise\api\scripts\populate_createdby_guides.js xrcise-mongodb:/    
    docker exec -it xrcise-mongodb /bin/bash
    mongo
    load("populate_createdby_guides.js");



6/12: 
    -Was working on getting running component working, so I can track stats from my gps watch.
    -Upgraded to angular 4.0, now it looks like auth0 problem: No JWT present or has expired

7/13:
    -Needed to create workout in past. So I created workout through webapp. Then bashed into mongo container and ran: db.workouts.update({guide: ObjectId("5967fea58a3853000e5c17f3")}, {$set: {createdAt: ISODate("2017-07-08T23:14:10.355Z"), completedAt: ISODate("2017-07-08T23:14:10.355Z")}})
7/18:
    TODO: Previous workouts are being retrieved in two spots. Once in strength-training-workout-exercises and once in strength-training-set.
    Actually its only retrieved once, but the form is built in strength-training-set. Maybe we can work on building the form in the parent.
7/20:
    Refactored previous workout information to be passed as object instead of observable. Now Im thinking previousWorkout data should be thrown into
    workoutFactoryService.createWorkoutByGuide. Its causing messy code in strength-training-set, and would eliminate inputs being passed down
    component hierarchy.

8/3:
    Adding createdAt for workouts.
9/8:
    Now retrieving guides w/ exercises in order. Need to run backfill_order.js on production. Next I need to add button on guide page that will update order.
 9/20:
    Need to create an orderBy pipe for guide exercises for use in guide.component.html   
10/6:
    Decided to nix the orderBy pipe. Apparently theres performance issues. If I need to update the order of an exercise I will update it in the DB for now.    
10/17:
    Fixed measurements api endpoint
    Updated node.dockerfile to use pm2-docker and use the process.json file
10/25:
    Started building out measurements. Created models, module, routes and measurements component.
    Next create measurements service.

TODO: 
    -Get .debug compose working
        - https://wannabeegeek.com/2016/12/17/debugging-asp-net-core-apps-running-in-docker-containers-using-vs-code/
    -Try running app in ubuntu bash, does it fix db volume issue?
        -Not sure theres a docker for windows subsystem
